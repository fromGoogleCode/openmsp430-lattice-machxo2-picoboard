OpenMSP430 is a verilog clone of the famous TI's MSP430 micro-controller . The OpenMSP430 core is being ported to all the FPGAs - xilinx , altera and actel , except to that of Lattice FPGAs . This project is going to address that missing piece .

The objective of this project is as follows :

1. Port OpenMSP430 to Lattice FPGA MachXO2 Pico Development Kit .
2. Bring up software development environment using Eclipse IDE .
3. Create a good Hardware and Software development guide and Tutorial .
4. Setup a base for the next exiting project - "Linking OpenMSP430 and Energia IDE (Arduino IDE for TI's MSP430)"
